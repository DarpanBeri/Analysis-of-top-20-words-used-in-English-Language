# Analysis-of-top-20-words-used-in-English-Language

This project analyzes the top 20 words used in English language and compares it with the top 20 words used by UK's Vicky Pollard.
I leanred about the existance of Vicky Pollard from an web article shown at my Computational Linguistics class. The article is UK's Vicky Pollards 'left behind'http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/6173441.stm .

The aim of the project is to compare the top 20 words used by a balanced corpus of English text and compare it with that of Vicky Pollard. Balanced Corpus is a corpus collected with the purpose of representing a balanced variety of English text types: fiction, poetry, speech, non fiction, and so on.
I will be using the Brown Corpus for this. It consists about 1.2M words(which can be argued that are not enough).

Technology used: Python
Library used: nltk
