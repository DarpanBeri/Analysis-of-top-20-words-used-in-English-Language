# Analysis-of-top-20-words-used-in-English-Language

This project attempts to verify the claim by the BBC News article: UK's Vicky Pollard's [left behind](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/6173441.stm). The article claims

  "Britain's teenagers risk becoming a nation of "Vicky Pollards" held back by poor verbal skills, research suggests.
  And like the Little Britain character the top 20 words used, including yeah, no, but and like, account for around a third of all words, the study says."

This project is based off an assignment I did in my Computational Linguistics Course taught by [Professor Jean Mark Gawron](https://gawron.sdsu.edu/).

### Aim of the Project:

The aim of the project is to determine how many word types are there in third of English balanced corpus.

**Note:** A balanced corpus is a corpus collected with the purpose of representing a balanced selection of text genres and sources.

### Resources used:
* Brown Corpus: It consists about 1.2M words(which can be argued that are not enough).
* Technology used: Jupyter Notebook, Python
* Library used: nltk

### How to setup on your machine:
**Note:** Jupyter Notebook is required to reproduce the results in your local machine.
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open pollardAnalysis.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow instructions in the Jupyter Notebook.
