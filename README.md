# Analysis-of-top-20-words-used-in-English-Language

This project analyzes the top 20 words used in English language and compares it with the top 20 words used by Little Britain's character Vicky Pollard. I learned about the existance of Vicky Pollard from the BBC's web article shown at my Computational Linguistics class. The article is UK's Vicky Pollards 'left behind' and can be found [here](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/6173441.stm).

### Aim of the Project:
The aim of the project is to compare the top 20 words used by a balanced corpus of English text and compare it with that of Vicky Pollard.

* A balanced corpus is a corpus collected with the purpose of representing a balanced variety of English text types: fiction, poetry, speech, non fiction, and so on.

### Resources used:
* I will be using the Brown Corpus for this. It consists about 1.2M words(which can be argued that are not enough).
* Technology used: Jupyter Notebook, Python
* Library used: nltk

### How to setup on your machine:
**Note:** Jupyter Notebook is required to reproduce the results in your local machine.
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open pollardAnalysis.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow instructions in the Jupyter Notebook.
